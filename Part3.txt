1. In terms of coding, the problem was fairly simple. I was about to make a mistake by checking for 
scalene before right triangles. The problem with this would have been that all right triangles would
have been classified as scalene instead of right. As for writing tests, it's been a while since I've done
geometry so I had to look online for examples of right triangles.
2. The specifications are almost airtight. The mention almost everything they need except for a check
to see if a, b, and c can actually make a valid triangle.
3. I have experience with python unittest before, so the tools didn't provide any issues for me.
4. I knew I was done once I tested every possible outcome from the Classify_triangle function.
I tested to make sure each output was occuring when it was supposed to and made sure it wasn't
occuring when it wasn't supposed to.
